I'm not ready for this, 
Though I thought I would be. 
I can't see the future, 
Though I thought I could see. 

I don't want to leave you, 
Even though I have to. 
I don't want to love you. 
Oh, I still do. 

Need some time to find myself. 
I wanna live within. 

Can I go my own way? 
Can I pray my own way? 
I don't want to leave you. 
Oh, I need you. 

Am I ready for this? 
Did I think I would be? 
Can I see the future? 
No, I can't see. 

I don't want to leave you, 
Even though I have to. 
I don't want to love you. 
Oh, I still do. 

Ah, la la da da da. 
Ah, I still do. 

Ah, la la da da da. 
Ah, I still do.

Oh, my life is changing everyday,

In every possible way.
And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems,
Never quite as it seems.

I know I've felt like this before, but now I'm feeling it even more,
Because it came from you.
And then I open up and see the person falling here is me,
A different way to be.

Ah, la da ah...
La...

I want more impossible to ignore,
Impossible to ignore.
And they'll come true, impossible not to do,
Impossible not to do.

And now I tell you openly, you have my heart so don't hurt me.
You're what I couldn't find.
A totally amazing mind, so understanding and so kind;
You're everything to me.

Oh, my life,
Is changing every day,
In every possible way.

And oh, my dreams,
It's never quite as it seems,
'Cause you're a dream to me,
Dream to me.

Ah, da, da da da, da, la...

Oh, do you know, 

Where to go, where to go? 
Something on your mind, 
Wanna leave me behind, wanna leave me behind. 

You're spinning me around, 
My feet are off the ground. 
I dunno where I stand. 
Do you have to hold my hand? 
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me... 

Oh, when he walked into the room, 
It happened oh so soon. 
I didn't want to know. 
Does he really have to go? 
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me... 

And I couldn't find the words, 
To say, "I love you." 
And he couldn't find the time, 
To say, "I need you." 
It wouldn't come out right. 
It wouldn't come out right. 
Just came out all wrong. 

You're spinning me around, 
My feet are off the ground. 
I dunno where I stand. 
Do you have to hold my hand? 
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me... 

Oh, do you know, 
Where to go, where to go? 
Something on your mind, 
Wanna leave me behind, wanna leave me behind.

You're so pretty the way you are. 

You're so pretty the way you are. 
And you had no reason, 
To be so insolent to me. 
You're so pretty the way you are. 

La, la, you got to say it if you want to, 
But you won't change me. 
La, la, you got to say it if you want to, 
But you won't change me. 

You're so pretty the way you are. 
You're so pretty the way you are. 
And you had no reason, 
To be so insolent to me. 
You're so pretty the way you are. 

La, la, you got to say it if you want to, 
But you won't change me. 
La, la, you got to say it if you want to, 
But you won't change me.

Another head hangs lowly, 
Child is slowly taken. 
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken? 

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family. 
In your head, in your head they are fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are crying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, dou, dou, dou, dou, dou... 

Another mother's breakin', 
Heart is taking over. 
When the vi'lence causes silence, 
We must be mistaken. 

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen. 
In your head, in your head they're still fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are dying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-a...

If you, if you could return, don't let it burn, don't let it fade. 

I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude, 
It's tearing me apart, It's ruining everything. 

I swore, I swore I would be true, and honey, so did you. 
So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand? 
Were you lying all the time? Was it just a game to you? 

But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 
Do you have to let it linger? 

Oh, I thought the world of you. 
I thought nothing could go wrong, 
But I was wrong. I was wrong. 
If you, if you could get by, trying not to lie, 
Things wouldn't be so confused and I wouldn't feel so used, 
But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you. 

But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 
Do you have to let it linger? 

And I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 
Do you have to let it linger? 

You know I'm such a fool for you. 
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 
Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 
Do you have to let it linger?

Keep on looking through the window again, 

But I'm not sorry if I do insult you. 
I'm sad, not sorry, 'bout the way that things went, 
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsakin' thee. 

I swore I'd never feel like this again, 
But you're so selfish, you don't see 
What you're doing to me, 
I keep on looking through the window again. 
No I'm not sorry if I do insult you. 
No-o-o, I'm not sorry if I do insult you. 

You told me lies, and I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed. 
'Cause you lied, lied, and I cried, yes I cried, yes, I cry, I cry, I try
again. 

I realize, as he sighed, and he sighed and he sighed. 
'Cause you lied, lied, and I cried, yes I cried, yes, I cry, I cry, I try
again. 

Keep on looking through the window again, 
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you. 
I'm sad, not sorry, 'bout the way that things went, 
And you'll be happy and I'll be forsakin' thee. 

I swore I'd never feel like this again, 
But you're so selfish, 
You don't see what you're doing to me, 
I keep on looking through the window again. 
No I'm not sorry if I do detest you. 
No-o-o, I'm not sorry if I do detest you. 

You told me lies, and I sighed, and I sighed, and I sighed. 
'Cause you lied, lied, and I cried, yes I cried, yes, I cry, I cry, I try
again. 

I realize, as he sighed, and he sighed and he sighed. 
'Cause you lied, lied, and I cried, yes I cried, yes, I cry, I cry, I try
again. 

Keep on looking through the window again. 
Keep on looking through the window again...

Still can't recognize the way I feel (I feel, I feel). 

Nothing of what you said to me was real. 
And you still can't find the strength, 
To apologize, (-ogize, -ogize). 
You just go on laughing and telling everyone lies. 

'Cause you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all. 
No, and there's nothing at all, 
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all. 

Maybe if you could see beyond, 
Your nose, (your nose, your nose). 
Nothing of what has happened surely shows. 
But your ego excelled and then your attitude. 
And you went on laughing and shouting, 
It's all too shrewd. 

'Cause you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all. 
No, and there's nothing at all, 
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all. 

La na na na, la la... 

Still can't recognize the way I feel (I feel, I feel). 
Nothing of what you said to me was real. 
And you still can't find the strength, 
To apologize, (-ogize, -ogize). 
You just go on laughing and telling everyone lies. 

'Cause you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all. 
No, and there's nothing at all, 
There's nothing at all, there's nothing at all. 

La na na na, la la... 
Wanted it all, wanted it all, you wanted it all.

Sittin' in an armchair,

With my head between my hands; 
I wouldn't have to feel like this 
If you'd only understand 

Too many misunderstandings 
Causing such delay 
And if it doesn't work like this 
Well I'll try another way 

Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
Oh, I didn't understand 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
Oh, I didn't understand 

You know that all I wanted was 
To be there by your side 
And if you didn't want it 
Well you shouldn't have denied 

You knew that you were someone special 
Right from the start 
But if you treat me badly 
We'd be better off apart 

Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
Oh, I didn't understand 
Oh, if this is the way you wanted it 
Oh, I didn't understand, understand 

And now, it's all the same to me, 

So be whatever you want to be, 
And go wherever you need to go. 

And when it all seems like a mistake, 
Take whatever you need to take, 
And leave the rest for my own sake. 

I will always, 
Go beside you, 
You will always, 
Understand. 

And now, it's all the same to me, 
So be whatever you want to be, 
And go wherever you need to go. 

And when there's nothing left behind, 
Taken whatever you needed to, 
And leave it all into my mind. 

I will always, 
Go beside you, 
You will always, 
Understand.

Let me take you by the hand, 

Away from here to another land. 
Oh, this land in which we live, 
Where people love and are meant to forgive. 

And you always put me wrong, 
'Cause you're always putting me down. 

I can't take this anymore. 
I decided to leave, 
Walked out through the door. 
Oh, and why do you think I go? 
Because you know it can never be so. 

And you always put me wrong, 
'Cause you're always putting me down. 

La, la la la, la la la... 

So let me take you by the hand, 
Away from here to another land. 
Oh, this land in which we live, 
Where people love and are meant to forgive. 

And you always put me wrong, 
'Cause you're always putting me down. 

La, la la la, la la la...

A disappointment. 
Oh, you shouldn't have done, 
You couldn't have done, 
You wouldn't have done the things you did then. 

And we could've been happy. 
What a piteous thing, 
A hideous thing was tainted by the rest, 
But it won't get any harder, 
And I hope you'll find your way again. 

And it won't get any higher, 
And it all boils down to what you did, 
Then... 

In the night we fight, I fled, you're right. 
It was exactly then, it was exactly then, 
I decided, decided, decided, decide. Oh, that threw you out. 

In the night we fight, I fled, you're right. 
It was exactly then, it was exactly then, 
I decided, decided, decided, decided. Mmm... Mmmm... 

But it won't be any harder, 
And I hope you'll find your way again. 
And it won't get any higher, 
And it all boils down to what you did, 
Then... 
Disappointment... 
Then... 

Na, na na na. Na, na, na... 

Silenced by death in the grave, 
Da da da da. William Butler Yeats couldn't save. 
Da da de da. Why did you stand here, 
Were you sickened in time? 
But I know by now. 
Why did you sit here, ah... 

In the grave, in the gra-a-ave. 
In the grave, in the gra-a-a-ave? 

Why should I blame her, 
that she filled my days with misery, 
Or that she would of late have taught 
To ignorant men most violent 
Ways or hurled the little streets upon the great. 
Had they but courage equal to desire. 

Sad that Maud Gonne couldn't stay, 
Da da da da, but she had Mac Bride anyway. 
And you sit here with me on the Isle Inisfree, 
And you're writting down ev'rything. 
But I know by now. 
Why did you sit here, ah... 

In the grave, in the gra-a-ave. 
In the grave, in the gra-a-a-ave? 
La da da da; La da da da... 

Why should I blame her, 
Had they the courage equal to desire. 

There's no need to argue anymore. 
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore. 
And the thing that makes me mad, 
Is the one thing that I had, 

I knew, I knew, 
I'd lose you. 
You'll always be special to me, 
Special to me, to me. 

And I remember all the things we once shared, 
Watching T.V. movies on the living room armchair. 
But they say it will work out fine. 
Was it all a waste of time. 

'Cause I knew, I knew, 
I'd lose you. 
You'll always be special to me, 
Special to me, to me. 

Will I forget in time, ah, 
You said I was on your mind? 
There's no need to argue, 
No need to argue anymore. 
There's no need to argue anymore. 

Ouuu, ouuu, ouuuu... 
Special.
It was the fearful night of December 8th. 
He was returning home from the studio late. 
He had perseptively known that it wouldn't be nice. 
Because in 1980, he paid the price. 

John Lennon died. 

With a Smith & Wesson 38, 
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate. 
He should have stayed at home, 
He should have never cared, 
And the man who took his life declared, 

He said I just shot John Lennon. 
He said I just shot John Lennon. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening night. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening night. 

Ah, ah ah ah, ah... 

I just shot John Lennon. 
He said I just shot John Lennon. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening night. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight. 
What a sad and sorry and sickening night. 

Ah, ah ah ah, ah...

Who will save the war child baby? 
Who controls the key? 
The web we weave is thick and sordid, 
Fine by me. 

At times of war we're all the losers, 
There's no victory. 
We shoot to kill and kill your lover, 
Fine by me. 

War child, victim of political pride. 
Plant the seed, territorial greed. 
Mind the war child, 
We should mind the war child. 

I spent last winter in New York, 
And came upon a man. 
He was sleeping on the streets and homeless, 
He said, "I fought in Vietnam." 

Beneath his shirt he wore the mark, 
He bore the mark with pride. 
A two inch deep incision carved, 
Into his side. 

War child, victim of political pride. 
Plant the seed, territorial greed. 
Mind the war child, 
We should mind the war child. 

Who's the loser now? Who's the loser now? 
We're all the losers now. We're all the losers now. 

War child.

Hold onto love that is what I do now that I've found you. 
And from above everything's stinking, they're not around you. 

And in the night, I could be helpless, 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you. 

And in the day, everything's complex, 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you. 

But I'll miss you when you're gone, that is what I do. Hey, baby! 
And it's going to carry on, that is what I do. Hey, baby... 

Hold onto my hands, I feel I'm sinking, sinking without you. 
And to my mind, everything's stinking, stinking without you. 

And in the night, I could be helpless, 
I could be lonely, sleeping without you. 

And in the day, everything's complex, 
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you. 

But I'll miss you when you're gone, that is what I do. Hey, baby! 
And it's going to carry on, that is what I do. hey, baby...

Don't do it, don't do it. 
Inject your soul with liberty, 
It's free, it's free.
